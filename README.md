# rubix-repo
Possible ML project to find optimal cube-solving methods

My thinking around the project

1. Create a way to model the rubix cube in a layered array with colour coded letters
2. Create defined functions that mirror the way that the rubix cube operates
(possible moves:
Right up/down, top left/right, bottom left/right, left up/down)
Can be represented with RU, RD, TL etc.
These create changes to the array.

Dependencies:
- model will eventually depend on file defining all move functions
